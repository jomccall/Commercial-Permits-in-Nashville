## General Information
Nashville has been seeing a commercial boom in the last decade. Many large businesses have established headquarters downtown, such as Bridgestone and Alliance Bernstein. In 2020 COVID-19 hit and as more office workers began to work from home the future of in office work comes into question. How many people will go back full time? How many offices will implement hybrid models of remote and in-person work? How many companies will go completely remote? In a city like Nashville that's been riding off of a boom for quite some time, can we get insights on this from permitting data?
